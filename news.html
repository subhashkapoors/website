					<h3>There is a fun way to learn those math tricks- Are you game?</h3>
					<p>In recent years, enormous progress has been made in most aspects of people’s lives; in communication technology, education and so forth, which has contributed to making the way to educate people very different from how it was previously done. Therefore, the majority of people desire to use this technology and benefit from these advancements in order to expand their knowledge and acquire new skills. As a result, the way of learning has changed, for students used to study in classrooms by using books and discussing the important issues with their lecturers face-to-face. Now, however, they may not need to go to the university at all. There are some people who earned their degrees and they have never gone to the university or met their instructors. Therefore, this essay aims to compare between e-learning and traditional face-to-face learning by exploring the advantages and disadvantages of these pedagogical learning styles.</p>

					<p>To start, e-learning is defined as interactive learning in which students learn through the usage of computers as an educational medium. Students who study online usually gain automatic feedback about their own activities. The focus of e-learning is usually on the learning of content rather than communication between students and instructors. According to Hassenburg, e-learning covers a wide set of applications and processes. These materials include multimedia online activities such as the web, internet videos CD-Rom, TV and radio. Students, therefore, are expected to be able to use these materials to teach themselves (2009: 18-25).</p>

					<p>However, the traditional classroom has not all been positive. Many studies have criticized that the amount of students in one classroom may not give a chance to students to participate who are shy about communicating with their teachers in front of peers. Online learning gives these types of students a greater opportunity to communicate by email or chat, far from a physical classroom.</p>

					<p>Obviously, it can be seen that both e-learning and the traditional classroom have their own positives as well as negative qualities. Therefore, Alonso Díaz, and Blázquez Entonado report that many studies suggest that the best solution is to combine the two ways of learning, which is known as “blended learning” (2009: 331-343). Moreover, the role of the teacher is important. Hence, if a teacher interacts with the students at computer, the students’ motivation to use it increases and vice versa.</p>
